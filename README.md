# Weather-and-Kanye-API
This project I used 2 apis, a weather and a Kanye quote API. It connects to a libera chat room (#CS2336), and uses a pircbot to communicate with the user.
If the user wants to see the weather at a certain city, they can enter the name of the city they want and it'll output the weather at that city.
If the user wants to see a random kanye quote, they can enter Kanye and it'll output the quote.
